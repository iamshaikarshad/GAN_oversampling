GAN-Based Oversampling for Customer Retention Prediction

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to address class imbalance in customer retention datasets. By generating synthetic samples for the minority class, the model aims to improve the performance of classification algorithms in predicting customer retention.

Overview

Class imbalance is a common issue in predictive modeling, where the number of instances in one class significantly outnumbers the other. Traditional oversampling techniques like SMOTE or random oversampling may not capture the underlying data distribution effectively. This project leverages GANs to generate realistic synthetic data for the minority class, thereby enhancing the classifier's ability to learn from balanced data.

[Minority Class Data] --> [Generator] --> [Synthetic Data]
                                     |
                                     v
[Real Data] --> [Discriminator] <--> [Synthetic Data]
                                     |
                                     v
                            [Improved Classifier]

In this setup:

    The Generator creates synthetic data resembling the minority class.

    The Discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the synthetic data against real data.

    The Classifier is trained on the augmented dataset, leading to improved performance.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/iamshaikarshad/GAN_oversampling.git
cd GAN_oversampling

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Prepare the dataset:

        Place your dataset in the data/ directory. Ensure it is in CSV format with appropriate preprocessing.

    Run the Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook retention_Oversampling_Gan.ipynb

    Follow the steps in the notebook:

        Load and preprocess the data.

        Train the GAN model to generate synthetic minority class samples.

        Augment the original dataset with synthetic samples.

        Train and evaluate the classifier on the balanced dataset.
